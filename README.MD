# Tech News 
  
  ## Description
Tech News is a simple platform for sharing tech articles. 
 This was one of my first times working in both Java and AWS. I deployed an EC2 instance via Ubuntu and used RDS to host a MySQL server. The Java API uses:

  * Thymeleaf to render the MVC routes

  * Springboot to render the routing to the web

  * JDBC to handle creating an ORM

  * Mysql connector to help JDBC make requests
